# Flexivote

Every election there are a lot of people who miss out on voting due to being present in their registered constituency. Flexivote is designed to be a web based application which will have the following capabilities:

1. Allow an eligible voter to vote from any polling station in the country.
2. Verify the identity and eligibility of the voter to make the vote count.
3. Make the voting process anonymous and secure using blockchain for easy audit and faster results.
4. Invalidate duplicate votes and voter fraud.
